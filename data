Certainly. Here’s a **crisper and slightly less formal version** of the email while maintaining clarity and professionalism:

**Subject:** Heads-Up: Testing CoE Deck & Planning Call

Hi Graham,

Hope you're doing well.

I’ve walked Ruchan through the Testing CoE work we’ve consolidated so far with the advisory group. He suggested setting up a call with Mark, Rachel, you, and me to review the progress and align on the June pilot run.

I’m putting together a draft deck and will share it with you by Tuesday for feedback. We can plan a quick call on Thursday or Friday to go through it and finalize the content, ahead of a broader session in the first week of May.

I'll also loop in Rachel and Ruchan on the draft for their input.

Let me know if you have any suggestions in the meantime.

Best,  
Ravi

Would you like a version tailored for a Teams message as well, in case you want to follow up more informally?
