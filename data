Subject: Introduction – Ravi from Testing COE

Hi Kiran,

Hope you’re doing well. Congratulations on your new role as the Head of COE – looking forward to working together.

As you’re joining from 1st July, I thought it would be a good time to introduce myself and connect briefly ahead of that. I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing Center of Excellence.

I’ve been focusing on driving test strategy, identifying opportunities for automation and process improvement, and exploring GenAI-based approaches for test design. Happy to share more whenever convenient for you.

Let me know a suitable time for a short catch-up.

Best regards,
Ravi
