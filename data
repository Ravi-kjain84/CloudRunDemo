**Subject:** Confirmation of Business Testing Roles and Reporting Structure

Hi Ayush,

I’m Ravi Jain, recently assigned as the **Testing CoE Lead**, reporting to Ruchan. I’m responsible for driving the strategic execution and effectiveness of the Testing CoE across value streams, including defining the testing approach and improving delivery efficiency.

As part of my initial review of the testing setup, I came across the following names under your supervision, marked as *Business Testers*:

- Deepak Oberoi  
- Bhuvanesh Uniyal  
- Madoop Kandath  
- Kathija Fathima  
- Khushal Sabharwal  
- Sana Yasmin  

Could you please confirm if these colleagues, along with you, are currently involved in business testing? My understanding is that you're supporting Liquidity UAT—please confirm.

Also, your role is listed as *Business Tester*. Should this be updated to *Business QA Testing Lead*?

Happy to connect briefly if needed.

Best regards,  
**Ravi Jain**  
Testing CoE Lead
