Subject: Back from Leave | Updates & Approvals

Hi Rushan,

Hope you’re doing well.

I just wanted to inform you that I’ve rejoined the office today after my leave.

As discussed earlier, I’ll be working on the following items in preparation for our meeting scheduled next week on Tuesday, [Insert Date]:
	•	Creating the presentation slides for Milu and Kirsten Altman
	•	Documenting the related requirements and preparing for the discussion on sponsorship
	•	Pilot run activities for the June release
	•	Reviewing the proposed restructuring of the testing teams, as mentioned in our last meeting

Please let me know if you would like to connect before the scheduled meeting to align on any of these items.

Additionally, I’ve raised a ServiceNow request for Nexus 3 access, which is required for importing Python libraries in line with recent policy changes. Kindly review and approve the request. Let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]

Let me know if you’d like to include the request ID or adjust the tone further.
