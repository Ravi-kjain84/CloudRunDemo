Thanks for letting me know. I've provided access to the group, and the Testing Strategy document is currently under review. I'm incorporating feedback from multiple sources and will share updates in the upcoming advisory group meeting.

Hi Seema, Sandeep, and Nitin, I'll be adding you as optional attendees for the meeting. If you have any updates, references, or feedback, please feel free to share them there. If you'd prefer a separate discussion, do let me know.
