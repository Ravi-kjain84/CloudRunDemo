Subject: Update on Testing Strategy Activities Before Leave

Hi 

As I’ll be on leave for the next two weeks, I wanted to share a quick update on the ongoing activities related to the testing strategy, guidelines implementation, and upcoming steps:
	•	The June month-end pilot for RWA and CCR is progressing well under Rakesh Sharma’s leadership. The team is undergoing training on the new ways of working and applying the updated processes as part of the pilot.
	•	The solutions developed for the new ways of working will be validated in this pilot before formal rollout to broader teams.
	•	I am drafting a formal requirement to initiate ownership and delivery from the technology teams. This includes finalizing the sponsors and preparing for initial requirement forum presentations.
	•	On the GenAI-led test case generation, I am currently researching the methodology and technical feasibility. I will share a detailed proposal soon.
	•	As part of this initiative, I’ve identified the need for high-quality test cases to train GenAI models. I will request teams to compile test cases aligned with our test strategy guidelines.

Thank you for your continued support. Should you need to reach me during this period, please feel free to call or text me on my personal number. I’ll rejoin on 9th June.

Best regards,
Ravi

Let me know if you’d like a slightly more formal or relaxed tone.

Certainly. Below are the two additional tone versions using the same content:

Subject: Ongoing Testing Strategy Activities – Pre-Leave Update

Dear

As I will be on leave for the next two weeks, I am writing to provide a concise update on key activities related to the testing strategy implementation and planned next steps:
	•	The RWA and CCR pilot for the June month-end cycle is progressing under the leadership of Rakesh Sharma. The team is undergoing structured training and adapting to the updated testing processes.
	•	Solutions introduced under the new ways of working are being trialed in this pilot and will serve as the foundation for a broader rollout.
	•	I am currently drafting a formal requirement to ensure these solutions are officially owned and delivered by the respective technology teams. This includes confirming sponsorship and preparing for requirement forum discussions.
	•	In parallel, I am advancing research on integrating GenAI into our test case design process, and will soon share a proposed methodology for consideration.
	•	Given the model training needs, I will request teams to collate high-quality test cases that align with our approved testing guidelines.

Thank you for your continued support. I remain reachable via my personal number should any urgent matters arise. I plan to resume duties on 9th June.

Warm regards,
Ravi

2. More Relaxed Yet Professional Tone

Subject: Quick Update Before Leave

Hi

As I’m heading out on leave for the next two weeks, here’s a brief update on the key testing strategy activities and what’s coming up:
	•	The June-end pilot for RWA and CCR, led by Rakesh Sharma, is on track. The team is getting hands-on with the new ways of working and completing the necessary training.
	•	We’re using this pilot to test the solutions we’ve developed, with a view to rolling them out more broadly across teams.
	•	I’m preparing a formal requirement to bring in technology team ownership, including identifying sponsors and getting ready for initial requirement forums.
	•	I’ve also been exploring how GenAI can support test case creation, both from a theoretical and technical standpoint. I’ll be sharing a detailed approach soon.
	•	To support this, I’ll ask teams to pull together strong, strategy-aligned test cases that can be used to train the GenAI models effectively.

Thanks again for your support. If anything urgent comes up, feel free to call or message me on my personal number. I’ll be back on 9th June.

Best,
Ravi
