Thank you for the clarification.

Below is a sample query format based on your screenshot, rewritten for each column length validation as per your requirement. Each block uses a WITH clause to fetch data and a final SELECT to apply the CASE logic, returning only a single result column.

✅ Example 1: Post_Adj_Reason_Description (Max Length = 100)

WITH validation_data AS (
  SELECT 
    Post_Adj_Reason_Description
  FROM 
    `hsbc-12400091-rare6-dev.FCRP_WF_NCCR_HBFR_FCRP_ADJ_R04_00_2025_06_09_163152.FCRP_ECB_NCCR_RESULTS_EXTRACT_HBFR`
  WHERE 
    account_ID IN ('3710_1453_1234_0_9', '3710_1453_1234_1_9', '3710_1453_1234_2_9')
)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN LENGTH(Post_Adj_Reason_Description) <= 100 THEN 'PASS'
    ELSE 'FAIL'
  END AS result
FROM validation_data;

You can use the same structure to test each of the other attributes. Here is the list of required substitutions:

Attribute	Max Length
Adj_Reason_Code	6
Adj_Reason_Description	100
Adjustment_Row_Number	4
Adjustment_TimeStamp_Final	50
Post_Adj_Reason_Description	100
Post_Adj_Reason_Code	6
Post_Adj_Id	50
Post_Adj_Timestamp	50
Post_Adj_Type	10
Post_Adj_Username	10

✅ Example 2: Adj_Reason_Code (Max Length = 6)

WITH validation_data AS (
  SELECT 
    Adj_Reason_Code
  FROM 
    `hsbc-12400091-rare6-dev.FCRP_WF_NCCR_HBFR_FCRP_ADJ_R04_00_2025_06_09_163152.FCRP_ECB_NCCR_RESULTS_EXTRACT_HBFR`
  WHERE 
    account_ID IN ('3710_1453_1234_0_9', '3710_1453_1234_1_9', '3710_1453_1234_2_9')
)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN LENGTH(Adj_Reason_Code) <= 6 THEN 'PASS'
    ELSE 'FAIL'
  END AS result
FROM validation_data;
