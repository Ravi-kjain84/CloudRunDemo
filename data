Below are the salient features of the automation tools currently in use or under consideration. More detailed descriptions, including tool capabilities, use cases, and important reference links, are available in Appendix 10.5.


2. Validation via DataGuard in Non-Production
DataGuard will be used to validate baseline outputs and ensure functional correctness by identifying discrepancies and variances across releases and regulatory environments. It supports robust regression analysis without requiring cross-VPC communication. DataGuard configurations will be tailored per use case based on agreed dimensions and measures.

Further details are provided in Appendix 12.5.1.
