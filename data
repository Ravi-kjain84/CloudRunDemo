Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback—really useful inputs.

Some of your points (e.g. deployment alignment, Canary access, system scope) overlap with other feedback and will be covered in the next draft.

For data fabrication and future-state business testing, I’d appreciate a bit more clarity to incorporate them accurately.

I’ve set up a follow-up call to discuss further.

Best,
[Your Name]
