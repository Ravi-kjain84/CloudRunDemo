Hi All,  

Thank you for your inputs during the recent discussion on the Testing Environment Strategy.  

The Testing Advisory Group has been working on this further and is currently discussing the use of the **Pre-Prod (Canary) environment** for UAT purposes.  

Please find attached the **draft Testing Strategy Guidelines** for your review. Your feedback is welcome as we continue to shape the approach.
