Your instinct is right, and both options have merit. Here’s a practical breakdown:

Option 1: Keep the COE details in the email

Pros:
	•	Gives Kiran early context on your scope and initiatives.
	•	Positions you as proactive and structured.
	•	Reduces the need for heavy explanation during the call—he’ll likely come in with some context or follow-up questions.
	•	Shows alignment with strategic thinking and value delivery.

Cons:
	•	Might come across as slightly heavy for a first-intro mail, especially if the intention is just to say hello and connect.

Option 2: Keep the email lighter, save details for the call

Pros:
	•	Keeps the tone light, approachable, and strictly introductory.
	•	Allows for a more interactive first conversation where you can shape the discussion live.

Cons:
	•	Missed opportunity to give early visibility into your leadership and initiative ownership.
	•	The meeting could become introductory + exploratory, which may need more time.

Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

Keep the core message light but include one well-crafted line that hints at your current focus. It invites curiosity without overloading the email.

Subject: Introduction – Ravi from Testing COE

Hi Kiran,

Hope you’re doing well. Congratulations on your new role as the Head of COE – looking forward to working together.

As you’re joining from 1st July, I thought it would be a good time to introduce myself and connect briefly ahead of that. I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing Center of Excellence.

I’d be happy to share a quick overview of what we’ve been working on across test strategy, automation, and some early GenAI research—whenever convenient for you.

Let me know a suitable time for a short catch-up.

Best regards,
Ravi

This strikes a balance—light intro with enough substance to invite curiosity. Let me know if you’d like a slightly more formal or technical tone.
