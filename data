Perfect. You want to skip the “please engage like decent humans” line and replace it with a more forward-looking, collaborative closing. Very tidy.

Subject: RWA NCCR Pilot Plan – June & July | Discussion Call on Tuesday

Cc: Adrian Taylor, [Add Release Managers here]

Hi All,

As discussed with Rachel, Adrian, and Ritesh last week, we will be moving ahead with a two-pilot approach over the coming months, as part of our efforts to apply the revised Testing Strategy guidelines shaped by the advisory group discussions.

The details of the pilots are as follows:
	•	RWA NCCR June Month-End Pilot (Testing Strategy Guidelines Execution) – This pilot will focus on implementing the revised testing strategy framework.
	•	RWA NCCR July Month-End Pilot (Agile Way of Working) – As suggested by Adrian, this pilot will focus on piloting the Agile way of working.

The purpose of these pilots is to validate the proposed approach, support the incorporation of Agile practices, and ensure team alignment in preparation for the broader Q3 release activities.

I will be setting up a discussion call on Tuesday to walk through the plan in more detail and gather your inputs.

Looking forward to working together on this.

Best regards,
