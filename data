You’re absolutely on the right track. Since you’ve already outlined the Key Objectives of the Testing Strategy earlier in the document (Section 1.1), it makes much more sense to anchor this section to those rather than invoking a “Testing Strategy Framework” that hasn’t been defined.

Referring back to the objectives provides a stronger logical flow and avoids introducing a new concept mid-document. So yes—your approach is solid and will bring clarity.

Here’s a revised version of the two opening lines in Section 2:

2. Problem Statements and Solutions
Discussions with testing leads have identified key challenges within current testing practices. Each challenge below is paired with a targeted solution, guided by the testing strategy objectives outlined in Section 1.1.

And here’s a simple, conversational reply to David’s comment:

Reply to David:
Thanks, David—good catch. You’re right that “framework” wasn’t defined earlier, so I’ve updated the wording to refer to the testing strategy objectives outlined in Section 1.1, which this section builds on.

Let me know if you’d like help drafting a response to his second comment about using a table instead of bullets.

Good point—while the focus is on these four value streams for now, many of the guidelines are quite generic and will apply more broadly. A deeper dive into upstream/downstream systems and enhancements to the testing strategy will follow in later phases. I’ve reworded the section to make that clearer.

Scope for the Current Phase
The current phase centers on four key value streams: BFF (Business Finance Function), Financial Controls, Treasury, and Data. While the focus of analysis and discussion is on these specific areas, many of the observations and guidelines identified are intended to be broadly applicable across other business functions. This approach ensures that the foundational testing principles remain relevant enterprise-wide, even though examples are drawn from these four streams. A more detailed examination of upstream and downstream system interactions is planned for a subsequent phase, which will further refine the testing strategy—particularly in relation to integration dependencies and end-to-end coverage.
