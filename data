Subject: Rejoined After Leave | Updates and ServiceNow Approval Request

H

Hope you’re doing well.

I just wanted to inform you that I’ve rejoined the office today after my leave. In our last meeting, we had discussed the ongoing testing resource reallocation. Please let me know if I should block some time this week to discuss further, ahead of our next scheduled meeting on Wednesday, 18th June.

In preparation for the upcoming meeting, I’ll be working on the following items:
	•	Preparing a 2–3 slide presentation on TCoE progress for Chris and other senior stakeholders
	•	Drafting formal IT requirements for Testing automation and standardisation (including sponsor discussion)
	•	Executing pilot run activities for the June release

Also, I understand that Kieran is expected to join on 1st July. Would you prefer that I reach out to him in advance for an introduction, or should I wait until his formal onboarding?

Additionally, I’ve raised a ServiceNow request for Nexus 3 access, which is required for importing Python libraries in accordance with the latest policy changes. Kindly review and approve the request. Let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
