Yes, great suggestion. Here’s the revised version that makes those points sharper and clearly distinguishes between the **June pilot (testing strategy)** and the **July pilot (Agile Pod setup + team alignment):**

**Subject:** Thank You and Next Steps

Hi Adrian,

Thank you for your time yesterday. I truly appreciate your guidance—it’s been instrumental in shaping the next steps. Here’s the plan going forward:

1. **June Pilot – Testing Strategy:**  
   I’ve started aligning with Rakesh to prepare the team for the June month-end pilot focused on the overall testing strategy.

2. **July Pilot – Agile Pod Setup & Team Alignment:**  
   We’ll begin structuring the testing team into Agile Pods and align ways of working in preparation for the July month-end pilot run.

3. **Agile Model Draft:**  
   I’ll research and share a draft version of the Agile structure for your review and feedback.

4. **Stakeholder Discussion:**  
   I’ll set up a call with Ritesh, Rakesh, Girish, Krishan, and Rohit to walk through the plan. You’ll be added as optional.

5. **Success Criteria & Benefit Matrix:**  
   I’ll prepare a matrix outlining expected benefits and success measures for the June release and pilot.

6. **Q3 Testing Team Awareness:**  
   The Q3 team will be informed and encouraged to align with the June pilot’s strategy and guidelines.

7. **Advisory Group – 28 April:**  
   Once the draft is ready, I’ll invite you to the advisory group meeting to discuss the July pilot and Agile setup.

Thanks again for your support—I’ll keep you updated.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like a version that sounds slightly more formal or one tailored for executive-level stakeholders.
