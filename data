Got it — we want to nod at Agile without writing a manifesto about it. Something crisp, purposeful, and non-cringey. Here’s a refined version of that first paragraph, tightened up but still meaningful:

Subject: RWA NCCR Pilot Plan – June & July | Discussion Call on Tuesday

Cc: Adrian Taylor, [Add Release Managers here]

Hi All,

As discussed with Rachel, Adrian, and Ritesh last week, we will be moving ahead with a two-pilot approach over the coming months. These pilots are part of our effort to apply the revised Testing Strategy guidelines and begin aligning with an Agile way of working going forward.

The details of the pilots are as follows:
	•	RWA NCCR June Month-End Pilot (Testing Strategy Guidelines Execution) – This pilot will focus on implementing the revised testing strategy framework.
	•	RWA NCCR July Month-End Pilot (Agile Way of Working) – As suggested by Adrian, this pilot will focus on piloting the Agile way of working.

The purpose of these pilots is to validate the proposed approach and ensure team alignment in preparation for the broader Q3 release activities.

I will be setting up a discussion call on Tuesday to walk through the plan in more detail and gather your inputs.

Looking forward to working together on this.

Best regards,

Let me know if you want an even more distilled version like “…and initiate Agile adoption” or “…and reflect Agile practices.” But this one keeps it friendly, clear, and boardroom-safe.



Perfect. You want to skip the “please engage like decent humans” line and replace it with a more forward-looking, collaborative closing. Very tidy.

Here’s the final-final version of your email, with:
	•	No awkward begging for feedback
	•	A confident, collaborative closing
	•	Everything else intact and sharp

	•	RWA NCCR July Month-End Pilot (Agile Way of Working) – As suggested by Adrian, this pilot will focus on piloting the Agile way of working.

The purpose of these pilots is to validate the proposed approach, support the incorporation of Agile practices, and ensure team alignment in preparation for the broader Q3 release activities.

There. You’re ready to hit send without any more “just one more thing” edits. Or are you?
