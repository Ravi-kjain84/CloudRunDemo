Subject: Quick Update on Testing Activities Before Leave

Hi Ruchan,

Hope you’re doing well.

As I’ll be on leave for the next two weeks, I wanted to share a quick update on the ongoing testing strategy activities and what’s coming up:
	•	The June-end pilot for RWA and CCR, led by Rakesh Sharma (Test Lead), is progressing well. The team is getting hands-on with the new ways of working and completing the necessary training. We also have a demo planned with other RWA leads shortly.
	•	I’m drafting the formal requirement to help transition ownership of these solutions to the relevant technology teams. Sponsor discussions are in progress, and I plan to present it in the upcoming requirement forums.
	•	On the GenAI test case use case, I’m currently exploring both the theoretical and technical feasibility. Early signs are positive. However, we’ll need a good set of well-written test cases to train the models effectively, so I’ll be asking teams to consolidate test cases aligned with the strategy guidelines.

Thanks again for your support. In case of anything urgent, feel free to call or text me on my personal number (+91 9971399550). I’ll be back on 9th June.

Subject: Update on Testing Activities Before Leave

Hi Ruchan,

Hope you’re doing well.

As I’ll be on leave for the next two weeks, here’s a quick update on key testing strategy activities and next steps:
	•	The June-end pilot for RWA and CCR, led by Rakesh Sharma (Test Lead), is progressing well. The team is hands-on with the new ways of working and undergoing training. We’re also conducting a walkthrough/demo with other RWA leads.
	•	I’m drafting a formal requirement to transition ownership of the solutions to the respective technology teams.
	•	On the GenAI use case for test case design, my research confirms feasibility. However, strong, well-structured test cases are critical for model training. I’ll request teams to compile examples aligned with our approved guidelines.

Thank you for your continued support. I’ll remain reachable on my personal number (+91 9971399550) for any urgent matters. I plan to resume work on 9th June.

Best regards,
