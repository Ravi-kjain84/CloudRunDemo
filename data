Subject: Update on Testing Strategy Pilot Plan – June & July Month-End Focus

Hi Rachel,

Following our discussion, I connected with Adrian to walk through the proposed pilot plan for applying the testing environment and testing strategy guidelines. Adrian provided valuable feedback, and we agreed to refine our approach.

Instead of pursuing the pilot for the Q3.4 release, we will now focus on the June month-end release as the pilot for implementing the testing strategy guidelines. This shift was made considering scale, feasibility, and to ensure better control over the outcomes.

We also aligned on planning a July month-end pilot, which Adrian will lead with a focus on adopting an Agile way of working. The learnings from the June pilot will serve as a foundation to support the Agile pilot in July and guide training for the broader Q3 testing team.

We will work closely to ensure that the teams are well-aligned to Agile principles over the next 2–3 months, enabling a successful execution of both June and July pilots.

Please let me know if you would like to review the detailed plan, and I will be happy to walk you through it.
