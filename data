Here’s the full **markdown version** of your Agile Testing OKRs, with clear structure and formatting for tools like **Confluence**, **Notion**, **GitHub**, or **Markdown editors**:

## Agile Testing OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

These OKRs align with the current Testing KPIs framework and support Agile adoption by driving improvements in **effectiveness**, **efficiency**, and **governance**. Agile-centric metrics enhance iteration, collaboration, and team-level accountability.

### **Objective 1: Improve defect detection and test coverage across Agile cycles (Effectiveness)**

| Key Result                                                                 | Measurement Target            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Increase Defect Detection Rate during unit and functional testing         | ≥ 95%                         |
| Reduce UAT and production defect leakage over 3 Agile releases            | ≤ 5% leakage                  |
| Implement exploratory testing as a standard practice in Agile teams      | 100% rollout                  |
| Conduct root cause analysis for all high-severity defects in retrospectives | ≥ 90% of sprints              |
| Track and report defect trends per sprint using JIRA dashboards          | Implemented in all Agile teams |

### **Objective 2: Accelerate testing readiness and cycle time through automation (Efficiency)**

| Key Result                                                                 | Measurement Target            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Achieve automation coverage for functional/regression tests               | > 50%                         |
| Reduce average test cycle time (Ready to Test → Test Complete)            | > 30% reduction from baseline |
| Maintain test case availability before sprint-end demos or release cut-offs | > 90%                         |
| Establish reusable test automation libraries per product stream           | > 60% reusability             |
| Automate priority test scenarios and integrate into CI/CD pipelines       | > 50% pipelines by Q3         |

### **Objective 3: Strengthen accountability and traceability in Agile testing governance (Governance)**

| Key Result                                                                 | Measurement Target            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ensure traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects         | 100% in JIRA                  |
| Conduct test case reviews and approvals before sprint-end                 | 100% compliance               |
| Embed test coverage criteria into Definition of Done (DoD)                | 100% teams adopting           |
| Track code-to-test coverage ratio across Agile squads                     | Visible per release           |
| Review testing OKRs quarterly as part of Agile health checks              | ≥ 90% adherence reviewed      |

---

### **Objective 4: Enable Agile mindset and continuous quality improvement**

| Key Result                                                                 | Measurement Target            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Train Agile team members on testing KPIs and OKRs                         | 100% completion rate          |
| Introduce sprint-level quality scorecard based on testing KPIs           | Used in ≥ 90% retrospectives  |
| Improve velocity and quality trend alignment across 3 releases           | Demonstrated improvement      |
| Pilot T-shaped testing skills across roles in 2 Agile squads             | ≥ 2 pilots completed          |
| Integrate OKRs into Agile team dashboards (JIRA/Confluence)              | 100% by Q3                    |
