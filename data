Subject: Rescheduling Walkthrough Call for June Month-End Pilot – RWA-NCCR Sub-Value Stream

Email Body:

Hi All,

I hope you are doing well.

I am moving the walkthrough call to next week, as we are still finalizing certain points related to the June month-end pilot for the RWA-NCCR sub-value stream and the associated testing strategy.

The objective of this call is to walk the team through the Testing Strategy Guidelines implementation planned for the June month-end release. During the session, I will share the selected Testing Strategy Guidelines and the automation opportunities identified for this pilot, followed by a detailed walkthrough.

The call is scheduled for one hour to allow sufficient time for questions and discussions.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you also need a short note you can send while updating or resending the meeting invite? I can provide that too if needed.
