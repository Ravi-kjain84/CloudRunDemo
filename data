Yes, that’s a great instinct. Reordering the sentence to lead with the context makes the message clearer and more strategic—especially when you’re highlighting why leadership support is even more important here.

Here’s how you can restructure that paragraph while keeping the tone aligned and respectful:

⸻

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to align Testing teams within SVS PODs.
	•	A fortnightly check-in will help us monitor progress.
	•	Since this is not a direct Testing team initiative, but more of a cross-functional effort where the Testing COE plays an enabling role, it may benefit from stronger support from your end to help drive alignment and engagement.
	•	I can identify the key Sub-Value Stream Leads and initiate the discussion to set the context. As with Phase 1, your endorsement—whether through being copied on the note or replying with a brief acknowledgment—would help position this as a priority and signal alignment across teams.

Let me know if you’d like to make the tone slightly more formal or informal, or if you want a final clean copy of the full email.

Absolutely—you’re right, outreach can feel a bit formal or detached in this context. Here are a few natural alternatives that keep the tone warm and respectful:
	•	connect with
	•	reach out to
	•	send a note to
	•	get in touch with
	•	initiate the conversation with

Given the tone you’re aiming for, here’s a revised version of the sentence with a more natural flow:

I can connect with the Test and Design Leads to get things started. It would be helpful if I could copy you on the initial note, or if you could endorse the approach with a quick reply—just so it’s clear that we’re aligned and tracking this as part of our broader goals.

And here’s the full email with that change incorporated:

Subject: Support Required for Testing Strategy Implementation

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’d like to request your support on two key phases of our Testing Strategy implementation:

Phase 1: Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Governance
	•	I propose setting up a Working Group with all Testing Leads in the FCD team to review Testing Strategy Guidelines and explore integration with Design teams to optimize resource utilization.
	•	We’ll also need representation from Design Leads to improve collaboration between design and testing teams.
	•	I’ll coordinate the group to define a RACI on OKRs and track progress through weekly WG calls.

I can connect with the Test and Design Leads to get things started. It would be helpful if I could copy you on the initial note, or if you could endorse the approach with a quick reply—just so it’s clear that we’re aligned and tracking this as part of our broader goals.

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to align Testing teams within SVS PODs.
	•	A fortnightly check-in will help us monitor progress.

Let me know if you’re aligned with this approach or if there’s anything you’d suggest refining.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like to adjust for word count or tone further!

Perfect—this is a really thoughtful nuance, and it’s important to acknowledge that Phase 2 might need a bit more visible leadership support since it’s not being directly led by the Testing team. Here’s a revised version of that paragraph that captures your point clearly but with a respectful tone and collaborative spirit:

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to align Testing teams within SVS PODs.
	•	A fortnightly check-in will help us monitor progress.
	•	Similar to Phase 1, I can initiate the initial communication with the Sub-Value Stream Leads to get the conversation going. That said, since this isn’t a direct Testing team initiative but more of a cross-functional effort—where Testing COE plays an enabling role—it might benefit from a bit more push or visible support from your end. Your endorsement could help position this as a broader improvement to agile ways of working, which would ultimately benefit our testing processes as well.
