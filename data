Subject: Re: Testing CoE Strategy Advisory Group – Feedback Acknowledgment

Hi Seema,

Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback—really useful inputs.

I’m currently reviewing the points you’ve raised, especially around deployment alignment, Canary access, and system scope, which also echo feedback from other areas.

For data fabrication and future-state business testing, I’d appreciate a bit more clarity to ensure we’re aligned on expectations and ownership.

I’ll set up a follow-up call to discuss further.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
