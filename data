Here’s a short and clear response for each bullet point you received:

⸻

1. Handling test scenarios where upstream changes are not productionized
Update: Add a section on “Mocking and Stubbing Strategy” to simulate upstream changes when they are not available.
Follow-up Question: Should we also include a mandatory risk note in test exit reports if mocks are used?

⸻

2. Data Fabrication ownership
Update: Define a clear ownership model for fabricated test data – identify roles (e.g., QA Lead or Data Steward).
Follow-up Question: Do you expect data fabrication to be automated (via scripts) or manual creation?

⸻

3. Tying deployment schedules with Sprint end
Update: Explicitly align test cycles and deployment readiness with Sprint end dates; add in the plan.
Follow-up Question: Should testing sign-offs be a formal Sprint closure criterion?

⸻

4. Feature-based testing vs Data-driven/Regression
Update: Add a hybrid model – combine Feature-based testing during Sprints with Data-driven Regression after code freeze.
Follow-up Question: Should we prioritize feature stories for in-sprint automation as well?

⸻

5. Testing environment scope (dynamic interfaces, risks)
Update: Expand the environment strategy section to map external dependencies like RDHM, wREN/RMP, WDR; flag production risks.
Follow-up Question: Should we create a dependency tracking sheet for these interfaces?

⸻

6. Listing exact services (FCCP, NCCR RWA, etc.)
Update: Create a definitive list of services/systems covered in scope. Mention explicitly if FCCP is a generic term.
Follow-up Question: Would you prefer a simple table format listing Service Name, Environment, Risk Flag?

⸻

7. IT Access to Canary Environment and Role Definition
Update: Add a subsection detailing IT access needs for Canary and define related QA/IT roles clearly.
Follow-up Question: Should we document IT access requests formally in the test environment readiness checklist?

⸻

Would you also like me to prepare a 1-slide summary or a table you can quickly use for your discussion? It might help you sound even more organized.
