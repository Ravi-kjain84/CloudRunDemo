To introduce myself, I’m Ravi Jain, currently assigned as the Testing Serial Lead and reporting to Roshan. I’ve recently started in this role and am reviewing the current testing team structure.

As per the records shared with me, the following individuals are listed under your supervision and marked with the role of *Business Tester*:

- Deepak Oberoi  
- Bhuvanesh Uniyal  
- Madoop Kandath  
- Kathija Fathima  
- Khushal Sabharwal  
- Sana Yasmin  

Could you please confirm for my records whether these colleagues, along with you, are actively involved in business testing? My understanding is that you are currently supporting Liquidity UAT—please confirm if that is correct.

Also, your role is marked as *Business Tester*. Should this be updated to *Business QA Testing Lead*?

Happy to have a quick intro call if you’d prefer to walk through this.

Best regards,  
**Ravi Jain**  
Testing Serial Lead

Let me know if you want a version tailored for sending to the whole team.
