Subject: RE: AI in Finance Session

Hi All,

Thank you, Piyush, for the session.

Please find attached the presentation we went through yesterday on the GenAI testing use case.

To move ahead, I’ve scheduled follow-up calls with Piyush and Luke to go over the details and plan the next steps. The goal is to prepare a clear plan and connect again by the first week of June or earlier.

Appreciate your continued support.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
