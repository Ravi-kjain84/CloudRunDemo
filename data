Following our discussion, I connected with Adrian to walk through the proposed pilot plan for applying the testing environment and testing strategy guidelines. Adrian provided valuable feedback, and we agreed to refine our approach.

Instead of pursuing the pilot for the Q3.4 release, we will now focus on the June month-end release as the pilot for implementing the testing strategy guidelines. This adjustment was made considering the scale, readiness, and potential to better manage execution and learning outcomes.

We also aligned on a July month-end pilot, which Adrian will lead with an emphasis on applying the Agile way of working. The learnings from the June pilot will inform and support the Agile pilot in July, while also guiding the Q3 testing team for future quarter releases.

As a next step, I will set up a call with the release teams to ensure alignment and begin preparations. We will start by evaluating current gaps and progressively work towards applying the recommended guidelines through the upcoming pilot executions in June and July.







Following our conversation, I aligned with Adrian on the pilot plan. Based on his feedback, we’ve agreed to shift the pilot from Q3.4 to the June month-end release, focusing on applying the testing strategy guidelines in a more controlled environment.

We also discussed a July month-end pilot led by Adrian, centered on Agile ways of working. Learnings from the June pilot will support this and help ensure the Q3 testing team aligns with the strategy guidelines for upcoming releases.

As next steps, I’ll set up a call with the release teams to ensure alignment. We’ll begin by identifying current gaps and start planning towards applying the guidelines in the upcoming pilot runs.

Let me know if you’d like a version with emphasis on Agile integration or stakeholder coordination.

Perfect—here’s the updated version with “aligned” replaced by “agreed,” maintaining a professional and polished tone:

Subject: Updated Pilot Plan – June & July Month-End Releases



Following our recent discussion, I connected with Adrian to review the proposed approach for the testing strategy pilot. Based on his feedback, we have agreed on a revised plan.

Instead of proceeding with the Q3.4 release, we will now focus on the June month-end release as the pilot for applying the testing strategy guidelines. This shift allows us to manage scale more effectively and create a stronger foundation for future implementation.

In addition, we’ve agreed to plan a July month-end pilot, which Adrian will lead with a focus on adopting Agile ways of working. The insights gained from the June pilot will support this effort and ensure that the Q3 testing team is well-aligned to the testing strategy guidelines for upcoming quarterly releases.

As a next step, I will set up a call with the release teams to ensure alignment and begin preparations. Our focus will be on identifying current gaps and progressively planning towards guideline application in the upcoming pilot runs.

Thank you for your continued support.
