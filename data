You’re right—thank you for catching that. Here’s the revised version of the email with a clear mention of preparing the testing team to work in the Agile Pod structure for the July month-end:

Subject: Thank You and Next Steps on Strategy Planning

Hi Adrian,

Thank you again for your time yesterday. I truly appreciate the guidance you provided—it has helped me significantly in shaping the next steps of the strategy planning.

As a follow-up, here are the actions I will be working on:
	1.	Aligning Rakesh and the Testing Team for the June Month-End Pilot Run:
I’ve already initiated discussions with Rakesh to begin preparations.
	2.	Preparation for July Month-End – Agile Pod Structure:
We will start aligning the testing team to work in an Agile Pod structure for the July month-end pilot run. The focus will be on embedding Agile ways of working within the team.
	3.	Agile Implementation Research and Planning:
I’ll conduct research and draft a version of how the Agile setup should look for our context. I’ll share this with you for review and feedback.
	4.	Stakeholder Discussion:
I’ll set up a call with Ritesh, Rakesh, Girish, Krishan, and Rohit to walk through the plan. I’ll include you as optional in the invite.
	5.	Benefit Matrix and Success Criteria:
I will draft a matrix outlining expected benefits and success criteria for both the June month-end release and the pilot run.
	6.	Q3 Testing Awareness:
I’ll ensure the Q3 testing team is made aware of the guidelines, with a focus on aligning to the strategy and learning from the June pilot experience.
	7.	Advisory Group Meeting on 28th April:
Once the draft is ready, I’ll invite you for a discussion during the advisory group meeting. This will cover the Agile-based pilot preparation for July and the proposed way forward.

Thanks again for your support—I’ll keep you updated as we move ahead.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
