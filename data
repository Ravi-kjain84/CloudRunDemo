Certainly. Here’s the updated version with a brief mention of your current COE initiatives, keeping the tone balanced and professional:

Subject: Introduction – Ravi from Testing COE

Hi Kiran,

Hope you’re doing well. Congratulations on your new role as the Head of COE – looking forward to working together.

As you’re joining from 1st July, I thought it would be a good time to introduce myself and connect briefly ahead of that. I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing Center of Excellence.

At present, I’m focusing on strengthening test governance, driving test automation, and embedding GenAI into our test design process—initiatives that I’m keen to align with your broader vision once you come on board.

If you’re available sometime soon, I’d be happy to set up a quick call at your convenience.

Looking forward to the conversation.

Best regards,
Ravi

Let me know if you’d like to tailor the initiative line further based on ongoing workstreams.
