To introduce myself, I am Ravi Jain, and I have recently joined as the FCD-TCoE Lead, reporting to Ruchan. Currently, I am working on Test Strategy Guidelines and alignment with the Agile way of working, in collaboration with the Testing Advisory Group.

In the initial draft shared with Ruchan, he raised some questions regarding the USD benefit estimation of the execution strategy. (Please also refer to the start of the email chain for context.)

To support the estimation analysis, I am currently gathering cost estimates for FTEs and FCDP environments. For example, I am looking into the average cost of FTEs (onshore/offshore) across different GCB levels, as well as the cost associated with maintaining any development environment used for testing in FCDP.

Michael provided some insights and recommended I connect with you for more detailed information. Would it be possible for you to share the relevant data on current cost estimations for FTEs by GCB level (onshore/offshore), and the costs related to environment maintenance?

Thank you in advance for your help. Please let me know if we need a quick connect to discuss this further—I’d be happy to set something up.
