DataGuard: SmartCompare for Testing Consistency

DataGuard is a tool designed to help teams identify discrepancies and variances in datasets across multiple releases and regulatory environments. It supports data integrity and consistency, particularly in complex reporting scenarios.

Built on Looker with BigQuery and Python integrations, DataGuard includes the SmartCompare module, which enables targeted validation of critical metrics across batches, environments, and regulatory views.

SmartCompare allows users to select datasets, regulators, and environments using dropdown filters, then compares metrics like RWAs, Exposures, and Estimated Losses. This ensures alignment across releases and regulatory expectations.

The tool highlights inconsistencies across regulatory standards to support compliance and flags early regressions in data, helping teams act proactively within the development cycle.
