Absolutely—you’re right, outreach can feel a bit formal or detached in this context. Here are a few natural alternatives that keep the tone warm and respectful:
	•	connect with
	•	reach out to
	•	send a note to
	•	get in touch with
	•	initiate the conversation with

Given the tone you’re aiming for, here’s a revised version of the sentence with a more natural flow:

I can connect with the Test and Design Leads to get things started. It would be helpful if I could copy you on the initial note, or if you could endorse the approach with a quick reply—just so it’s clear that we’re aligned and tracking this as part of our broader goals.

Subject: Support Required for Testing Strategy Implementation

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’d like to request your support on two key phases of our Testing Strategy implementation:

Phase 1: Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Governance
	•	I propose setting up a Working Group with all Testing Leads in the FCD team to review Testing Strategy Guidelines and explore integration with Design teams to optimize resource utilization.
	•	We’ll also need representation from Design Leads to improve collaboration between design and testing teams.
	•	I’ll coordinate the group to define a RACI on OKRs and track progress through weekly WG calls.

I can connect with the Test and Design Leads to get things started. It would be helpful if I could copy you on the initial note, or if you could endorse the approach with a quick reply—just so it’s clear that we’re aligned and tracking this as part of our broader goals.

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to align Testing teams within SVS PODs.
	•	A fortnightly check-in will help us monitor progress.

Let me know if you’re aligned with this approach or if there’s anything you’d suggest refining.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like to adjust for word count or tone further!

Perfect—this is a really thoughtful nuance, and it’s important to acknowledge that Phase 2 might need a bit more visible leadership support since it’s not being directly led by the Testing team. Here’s a revised version of that paragraph that captures your point clearly but with a respectful tone and collaborative spirit:

Phase 2: Agile Implementation
	•	We can initiate a Working Group with Sub-Value Stream Leads to align Testing teams within SVS PODs.
	•	A fortnightly check-in will help us monitor progress.
	•	Similar to Phase 1, I can initiate the initial communication with the Sub-Value Stream Leads to get the conversation going. That said, since this isn’t a direct Testing team initiative but more of a cross-functional effort—where Testing COE plays an enabling role—it might benefit from a bit more push or visible support from your end. Your endorsement could help position this as a broader improvement to agile ways of working, which would ultimately benefit our testing processes as well.
