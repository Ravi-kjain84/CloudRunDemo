Good point—while the focus is on these four value streams for now, many of the guidelines are quite generic and will apply more broadly. A deeper dive into upstream/downstream systems and enhancements to the testing strategy will follow in later phases. I’ve reworded the section to make that clearer.

Scope for the Current Phase
The current phase centers on four key value streams: BFF (Business Finance Function), Financial Controls, Treasury, and Data. While the focus of analysis and discussion is on these specific areas, many of the observations and guidelines identified are intended to be broadly applicable across other business functions. This approach ensures that the foundational testing principles remain relevant enterprise-wide, even though examples are drawn from these four streams. A more detailed examination of upstream and downstream system interactions is planned for a subsequent phase, which will further refine the testing strategy—particularly in relation to integration dependencies and end-to-end coverage.
