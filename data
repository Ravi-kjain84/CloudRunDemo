Here is a structured proposal draft for your testing resource allocation strategy. The draft is designed to be directly translatable into 2–3 presentation slides, followed by a structured table layout for easy visualization and discussion.

Slide 1: Objective & Scope

Title: Testing Resource Allocation Strategy – Proposal Overview

Objective:
To define a standardized methodology for testing effort estimation, resource allocation, and reporting across multiple projects in an Agile setup.

Scope Includes:
	•	Identification of testing types and their coordination needs.
	•	Effort estimation (story points or standard hours) for testing phases.
	•	Complexity-based effort breakdown across Design, Build, and Test.
	•	Velocity-based Agile capacity mapping.
	•	Matrix-based resource estimation for concurrent activities.
	•	Summary template across multiple projects.
	•	Agile pain map creation for bottleneck identification.

Slide 2: Methodology & Workflow

Title: Methodology for Estimation & Resource Allocation
	1.	Testing Types & Coordination Needs
	•	Functional, Integration, Regression, UAT, Performance, Automation
	•	Mapping coordination led by Test Leads (parallel & sequential efforts)
	2.	Effort Estimation
	•	Define task-level effort in Story Points
	•	Calibrate across S/M/L complexity (using Fibonacci series)
	3.	Design-Build-Test Split
	•	Allocate percentage effort for each testing phase
	•	Adjust by test type & complexity (e.g., Build-heavy in automation)
	4.	Velocity & Capacity
	•	Use Agile velocity to plan resource availability
	•	Align weekly/bi-weekly capacity with planned Story Points
	5.	Resource Matrix
	•	Map parallel vs. overlapping tasks
	•	Allocate resource count per test type and sprint phase
	6.	Standard Template & Summary View
	•	Reusable format to roll-up effort and resource need
	•	Consolidated dashboard across projects

Slide 3: Summary View & Agile Pain Map

Title: Consolidated View and Actionable Insights
	•	Multi-project Summary Template
	•	Aggregated view of test types, effort, FTEs, and velocity alignment
	•	Agile Pain Mapping
	•	Identify patterns in under-allocation, rework, backlog in testing phases
	•	Drive root-cause-based improvement
