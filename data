Subject: Action Required: Pending Compliance with Testing CoE Training

Hi Ritesh,

This is to bring to your attention that the following colleagues have not completed the mandatory training as outlined by the Testing CoE. The completion deadline was 16th May, and there has been no progress despite follow-up reminders.

As per our earlier alignment on the escalation process, I’m marking you for necessary action. I would appreciate your support in ensuring that the training is completed at the earliest.

Please let me know if any clarification is required.

Best regards,
Ravi
