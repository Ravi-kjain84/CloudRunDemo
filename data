Thank you for the clarification. Here’s the revised version with that point adjusted:

Subject: Introduction – Ravi from Testing COE

Hi Kiran,

Hope you’re doing well. Congratulations on your new role as the Head of COE – looking forward to working together.

As you’re joining from 1st July, I thought it would be a good time to introduce myself and connect briefly ahead of that. I’m Ravi Jain, currently leading the Testing Center of Excellence.

At present, I’m working closely with an advisory group comprising testing leads from various value streams and IT representatives to address key challenges across efficiency, effectiveness, and governance. We’ve drafted strategic testing guidelines and a common vision, and are currently piloting automation and standardization solutions in the June release. We’ve also initiated training on DAP and Agile for testing teams. Separately, I’ve been researching GenAI-based approaches to help generate effective test cases using JIRA requirement documentation as input.

If you’re available sometime soon, I’d be happy to set up a quick call at your convenience.

Looking forward to the conversation.

Best regards,
Ravi
