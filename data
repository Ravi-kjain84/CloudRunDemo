ðŸ“§ Subject: Appreciation for Rakesh Sharma â€“ June Pilot and Strategic Testing Contributions

â¸»

Dear Oh Rushan,

As discussed in our one-on-one today, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Rakesh Sharma, who is currently leading the June month-end release for the RWA sub-value stream under the Financial Controller value stream.

Rakesh has played a key role in supporting the pilot run for testing strategic solutions, contributing to the implementation of automated testing approaches, and aligning with governance practices. He is also currently training the RWA quarterly testing team for Q3 and supporting the ongoing Q3 pilot run.

His efforts have been valuable, and he continues to be a strong asset to the team.

Best regards,
Ravi Kumar Jain
