Thanks for sharing the screenshot. The message is clear in its intention, but it can be polished slightly for structure, grammar, and tone—especially since it’s addressing a stakeholder and referencing another senior colleague (Adrian Taylor).

Here’s a revised version:

⸻

Subject: RE: Ruchan & Ravi fortnightly 1:1

⸻

Hi Ruchan,

I’ve made some updates to the ‘Estimated Cost Benefit Analysis’ (slide 19) in the attached deck.

Adrian Taylor raised a query regarding the cost estimation slide, particularly the 42.4% utilization figure. I’ll need to align with him separately on that point.

In the meantime, I’ve removed the reference to resource utilization estimation from the cost estimation slide. It now only reflects the estimated benefits from improvements and cross-utilization.

Best regards,
Ravi

Let me know if you’d like a version that also summarizes the changes made to the slide or adds a note for next steps.
