Subject: Training Status: Extension Communicated to Teams, Requesting Support This Week

⸻

Hi Rohit, Gaurav,

As part of the testing enablement activities, I had earlier requested a group of Business Testers and QA Leads to complete two required trainings within a 3-week period, with a target completion date of Friday, 9 May. The details were outlined in the mail included below.

Just keeping you posted on the training compliance status from our team’s side.

As of today, none of the identified individuals have completed or updated their training status in the central tracker. A follow-up communication has now been sent to them from the Testing CoE mailbox. They’ve been requested to complete the trainings by Friday, 16 May, to allow one further window for completion and compliance.

To reinforce governance and ensure timely closure, I’m proposing the following escalation structure:

Week	Deadline Status	Action
Week 0	Completed within deadline	No action required
Week 1	Missed deadline	Level 1 escalation
Week 2	Still not completed	Level 2 escalation
Week 3	Continued non-compliance	Level 3 escalation

Rakesh is also supporting me in managing the month-end pilot and assisting with certain Testing CoE activities during this period.

Please find below the status update based on training completion as of today. We will continue sharing progress updates throughout the week using the Testing CoE mailbox for communication.

Let me know if there’s anything you’d like to discuss or clarify.

Thanks for your support.

Best regards,
Ravi
